# Logical Neural Network Operators

Python package for performing operations with logical operators.

The operations are performed by a neural network that analyzes the input given by the user and performs the logical operation, based on the 5 possible ones, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT.

## Installing the package:
 ``` pip install lpneuralnet ```

### Logical AND Operator:
``` import lpneuralnet as lpn```
``` lpn.runAnd() ```

### NAND Logic Operator:
``` import lpneuralnet as lpn```
``` lpn.runNand() ```

### OR Logic Operator:
``` import lpneuralnet as lpn ```
``` lpn.runOr() ```

### NOR Logic Operator:
``` import lpneuralnet as lpn ```
``` lpn.runNor() ```

### NOT Logic Operator:
``` import lpneuralnet as lpn ```
``` lpn.runNot() ```
